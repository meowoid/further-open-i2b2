<h2>Introduction</h2>
OpenFurther is an informatics platform that supports federation and integration of data from heterogeneous and disparate data sources.</div>

It has been deployed at the University of Utah (UU) as the Federated Utah Research and Translational Health e-Repository (FURTHeR) since August 2011 and is available for use by all U of U employees and students. OpenFurther links heterogeneous data types, including clinical, public health, biospecimen and patient-generated data; empowering researchers with the ability to assess feasibility of particular clinical research studies, export biomedical datasets for analysis, and create aggregate databases for comparative effectiveness research. With the ability to link unique individuals from these sources, OpenFurther is able to identify cohorts for clinical research.

It provides semantic and syntactic interoperability as it federates health information on-the-fly and in real-time and requires neither data extraction nor homogenization by data source partners, facilitating integration by retaining data in their native format and in their originating systems.

OpenFurther is built upon Maven, Spring, Hibernate, ServiceMix, and other open source frameworks that promote OpenFurther's code reusability and interoperability.

<h2>Browser Requirements</h2>
The i2b2 web client has been tested on all well known browsers. It works in both Windows and Mac OS. JavaScript must be enabled.

<h2>Help</h2>
For questions or help using OpenFurther, please reach out to the <a href="http://openfurther.org/community/" target="_blank">OpenFurther Community</a>.


<h3>Analysis Tools</h3>
The i2b2 web client contains an Analysis Tools page that provides plugins that perform a variety of data analysis and visualization functions. The Plugins view lists the available plugins for your project. OpenFurther currently supports only a Demographics analysis tool, which allows you to view demographic feature breakdowns (sex, age, etc.) for the result cohort. Click a plugin to load it into the Plugin Viewer. Some plugins contain additional help information for using that plugin.

<h2>About i2b2</h2>
The i2b2 web client was designed and built by Nick Benik from the Information Technology Department at Harvard Medical School and Griffin Weber, MD, PhD, who is the Chief Technology Officer of Harvard Medical School and a faculty member in the Division of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. We thank the i2b2 team at Partners HealthCare System for their assistance in creating this web client. For additional information about i2b2, please contact Susanne Churchill at <a href="mailto:schurchill@partners.org"> schurchill@partners.org</a>.<br/><br/>

Modifications to the i2b2 web client to support OpenFurther were designed and built by the staff of the Biomedical Informatics Core at the University of Utah.
