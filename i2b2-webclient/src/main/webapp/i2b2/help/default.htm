<h1>FURTHeR i2b2 Help</h1>
Version 1.3<br />
Updated December 8, 2011
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) is an NIH-funded National Center for Biomedical Computing. The i2b2 Center is developing a scalable informatics framework that will bridge clinical research data and the vast data banks arising from basic science research in order to better understand the genetic bases of complex diseases. This knowledge will facilitate the design of targeted therapies for individual patients with diseases having genetic origins. The i2b2 web client is a web-based interface to the i2b2 repository. It has been modified for FURTHeR to connect to the FURTHeR federated query engine in order to allow queries to span multiple, heterogeneous data sources.

<h2>Browser Requirements</h2>
The i2b2 web client has been tested on Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Firefox 2 and 3, Safari 3, and Chrome 15. It works in both Windows and Mac OS. JavaScript must be enabled.

<h2>Help Videos</h2>
The following videos provide instruction for using the various components of the i2b2 web client for FURTHeR

<h3>Analysis Tools</h3>
The i2b2 web client contains an Analysis Tools page that provides plugins that perform a variety of data analysis and visualization functions. The Plugins view lists the available plugins for your project. FURTHeR currently supports only a Demographics analysis tool, which allows you to view demographic feature breakdowns (sex, age, etc.) for the result cohort. Click a plugin to load it into the Plugin Viewer. Some plugins contain additional help information for using that plugin. See the <a href=/videos/Results%20Analysis.Test.mov target="_blank">Results Analysis</a> video for additional help on using the Demographics plugin.

<h2>About Us</h2>
The i2b2 web client was designed and built by Nick Benik from the Information Technology Department at Harvard Medical School and Griffin Weber, MD, PhD, who is the Chief Technology Officer of Harvard Medical School and a faculty member in the Division of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. We thank the i2b2 team at Partners HealthCare System for their assistance in creating this web client. For additional information about i2b2, please contact Susanne Churchill at <a href="mailto:schurchill@partners.org"> schurchill@partners.org</a>.<br/><br/>

Modifications to the i2b2 web client to support FURTHeR were designed and built by the staff of the Office of the AVP for Health Sciences IT at the University of Utah. For additional information about FURTHeR, please contact <a href="mailto:further@utah.edu"> further@utah.edu</a>.
